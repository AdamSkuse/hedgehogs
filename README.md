#Coding With Hedgehogs - WordPress Blog Theme

The aim of this project is to develop a basic WordPress theme from scratch. The theme must be mobile-friendly. Development must be mobile first, and the end theme must pass Google's Mobile-Friendly test.

Workflow will make use of the workflow and approach taught in Brad Schiff's Git A Web Developer course.

In terms of personal development, the aim is to introduce myself to the process of developing a WordPress theme from scratch, and come up with a workflow that I can apply to subsequent theme development.
